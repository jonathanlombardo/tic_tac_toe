# Infinite TicTacToe

Do you know TicTacToe? So boring... Not this one! I introduce you Infinite TicTakToe (I stole the idea from [this cute little thing](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/H6KqLlEQ0G4)):

### No draw possible

As soon as a player make the third move, all next moves will delete the oldest move!

### More strategy

Keep your eyes on game board and remember the all opponent moves, but don't forget yours! As soon as you think you're winning... puff... your cross is gone!

### Tecnologies

This little game has been develobed in JavaScript Vanilla.
